### GOAL
Perform an automated and strict review of the changes.

### CHECKS
- **Scope:** Changes are confined to `PROD_ROOTS`.
- **File Count:** The number of modified files is less than or equal to `MAX_FILES_PER_PR` (or a justification is provided).
- **Test Mapping:** Tests map one-to-one with acceptance checks.
- **Style:** Naming and style follow the guidelines in `/.dtaipd/core/ux/**`.
- **Code Quality:** There is no dead code or unnecessary abstractions.

### OUTPUTS
- Review notes.
- Small diffs applied directly to the code.
- An updated pull request with the reviewer notes appended.

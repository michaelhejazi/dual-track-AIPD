# Ship Feature

Follow `.dtaipd/.flow/commands/ship.md`.

- Only write in PROD_ROOTS and `.dtaipd/artifacts/`.
- TDD loop per task: write failing tests → implement → make tests pass.
- Use small Conventional Commits for tests and code.
- Produce `.dtaipd/artifacts/<feature>/Recap.md` on completion.

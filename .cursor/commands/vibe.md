# Vibe Prototype

Use the instructions in `.dtaipd/.flow/commands/vibe.md` to create a prototype from a user's description.

- Parse the user's description to infer a feature name and slug.
- If a workbench for the slug exists, use it; otherwise create it.
- You may create files and folders as needed within the workbench, but do not modify production code.
- Respect the guards in `.dtaipd/.flow/guards.md`.
